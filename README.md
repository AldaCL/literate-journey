# Wifi packet transmision simulation

Wi-Fi performance simulation, using the aloha protocol. 


Wifi2.py file, is the first part of proyect. It returns the Rbps of data in a transmision with a raw Rbps of 1Mbps. Implements Exponential Backup algorith, but in this case we're only working with one transmissor. Anyway, it takes a random number of DIFS and wait after a new transmission.
